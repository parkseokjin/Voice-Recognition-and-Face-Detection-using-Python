In order to train SVM model from scikit-learn python, you will need training data.

In 'images' file, you have to create the files according to the types of faces you want to train.

For example, if you want to train SVM to recognize 'John Wick', you will have to create the folder named 'John Wick' and put some images of John Wick for SVM training.

For each face you want to train, you have to create the folders with specific names.
